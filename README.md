# AI-Powered Music Style Transfer & Beat Generation

## Learning Journey

### **Project Overview**
In this project, you will develop an AI system that transforms a song from one genre to another (Music Style Transfer) and generates custom beats using reinforcement learning. This project introduces key AI concepts, including generative adversarial networks (GANs), deep learning for audio processing, and reinforcement learning for music creation.

### **Learning Goals**
By completing this project, you will:
- Understand **music style transfer** using **GANs** and deep learning models.
- Learn how to process and extract features from **audio signals**.
- Explore **reinforcement learning** to generate custom beats that adapt to different genres.
- Work with **waveform and spectrogram analysis** for AI-driven audio manipulation.
- Use **music synthesis tools** to generate beats and enhance compositions.

## **Phase 1: Music Style Transfer with GANs**
### **Objective**
Develop an AI-powered system that transforms a song from one genre (e.g., jazz) to another (e.g., rock) while preserving its core musical structure.

### **Steps**
1. Collect or use an existing dataset of music in different genres (e.g., GTZAN dataset).
2. Preprocess audio by converting it into spectrograms or Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs).
3. Train a **GAN-based model** (e.g., CycleGAN, StarGAN) to perform style transfer between music genres.
4. Convert the transformed spectrograms back into audio waveforms.

### **Key Concepts**
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** – Using deep learning to transform music styles.
- **Spectrogram Analysis** – Converting audio into a format that AI models can learn from.
- **CycleGAN & StarGAN** – Adapting image-style transfer techniques to music transformation.

## **Phase 2: AI-Powered Beat Generation**
### **Objective**
Train an AI system that generates unique beats and rhythms based on a given musical input.

### **Steps**
1. Use **reinforcement learning (RL)** to train an agent that generates drum beats.
2. Provide feedback mechanisms where AI refines beats based on **reward functions**.
3. Use **procedural generation techniques** to enhance beat diversity.
4. Sync AI-generated beats with the transformed musical input from Phase 1.

### **Key Concepts**
- **Reinforcement Learning** – Teaching AI to generate beats by maximizing rewards.
- **Procedural Music Generation** – Using algorithms to create dynamic music structures.
- **Waveform Manipulation** – Fine-tuning beat placement within a track.

## **Deliverables & Final Presentation**
- **A transformed song** that has been converted into a different genre using AI.
- **AI-generated drum beats** that complement the transformed song.
- A final mixed composition with style-transferred music and custom beats.
- A presentation explaining the **models and techniques used**.

## **Extensions & Future Enhancements**
- Fine-tune the GAN model to enhance **genre accuracy**.
- Improve reinforcement learning feedback by incorporating **human input**.
- Experiment with AI-powered **melody generation** to complement beats.

## **How to Get Started**
### **Backend Setup (Node.js & Express Example)**
1. Create a new project directory and initialize it:
   ```sh
   mkdir ai-music-transfer && cd ai-music-transfer
   npm init -y
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install express dotenv axios tensorflow tfjs-node
   ```
3. Create an `index.js` file and set up a simple Express server:
   ```js
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   app.use(express.json());
   
   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
       res.send('AI Music Transfer API');
   });
   
   app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
   ```
4. **Next Steps:**
   - Integrate TensorFlow.js to process and transform input music.
   - Add an endpoint for users to upload songs and receive transformed outputs.
   - Implement reinforcement learning to generate beats.

### **Frontend Setup (React Example)**
1. Create a new React app:
   ```sh
   npx create-react-app ai-music-transfer-frontend
   cd ai-music-transfer-frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install axios react-router-dom tone wavesurfer.js tensorflow tfjs
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
4. **Next Steps:**
   - Create an upload interface where users can submit music for transformation.
   - Display the AI-generated beats and transformed song for playback.
   - Allow users to fine-tune parameters for style transfer and beat generation.
